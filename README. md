It's now possible with a specific kind of machine learning called natural language processing (NLP). It teaches computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
LLMs (short for large language models) are a powerful tool within the broader field of NLP. These models are trained on insane amounts of data and can grasp the intricacies of human language. ðŸ¤¯ A popular LLM that you might already be using is GPT-3.
LLMs leverage deep learning techniques to generate text, translate languages, answer questions, and so much more. The model estimates the probability of a token or a sequence of tokens in a sequence. A token refers to a unit of language extracted from a larger piece of text.
However, accessing LLMs is a little tricky since training models is both time-consuming and expensive. APIs solve this. APIs serve as a tool to access NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more, which we'll explore today!
Exa (formerly "Metaphor") is an API (application programming interface) that retrieves the best content on the web. With Exa, anyone can semantically search the web to get high-quality, relevant information. With Exa's technology, we can rediscover the content on the internet. Unlike Google, which relies on keyword search (matching the exact words of the query to the web content), Exa can understand both the user's input and the content out there. Wow, right?

Exa utilizes LLMs as a core component, and has been extensively trained to help computers understand human language.
